# Sinatra API

Create an API for Whales using the template we used today in class.

Your API will will have the following:

1. A `GET` request that lists ALL whales
2. A `GET` requests that shows a single whale's information
3. A `POST` request that creates a brand new whale in the system
4. A `PATCH` request that updates a single whale's info
5. A `DELETE` requests that deletes a single whale
