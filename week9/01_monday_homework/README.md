# React Homework

Complete the in-class React challenge and then complete the following:

1. Clone down the [Express Boilerplate](https://github.com/ga-chicago/express-bp2) project from GitHub
2. Create a set of React components that are dynamically switched between whenever a user tries to sign up on the registration page.
3. Your app should load on the sign up form
4. Whenever a user enters information into the form, a "Dashboard" component should take the place of the sign up form component

We're basically recreating the challenge from earlier in the day except this time you're doing it yourself from scratch.
